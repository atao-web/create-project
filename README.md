# `@atao60/create-project`

üèó A personal CLI to bootstrap new projects. It offers the choice between three templates:
- Javascript
- Typescript
- [dummy-startup-kit](https://github.com/atao-web/dummy-startup-kit)

The first two ones are embedded: they can be installed only with the present stater kit.

The last one is a standalone boilerplate. It can also be installed with `git clone`.

None of them are production ready. They are just proofs of concept for this CLI npm package.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
npm init @atao60/project
# or
npx @atao60/create-project
# or
npm install -g @atao60/create-project
create-project
```
